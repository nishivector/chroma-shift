# Critic Feedback - Chroma Shift

## Review Summary
The game is well-implemented with solid mechanics. Here are the key observations:

### Strengths
- Unique dimension-switching mechanic with distinct physics per dimension
- Excellent visual feedback with color-coded dimensions
- Smooth camera follow and player controls
- Good use of bloom post-processing for glow effects
- Mobile touch controls implemented

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Level Design**: Add more progressive difficulty - current level is quite short
2. **Visual Polish**: Add particle effects when switching dimensions
3. **Audio**: Background music would enhance the experience
4. **Tutorials**: First-time players need guidance on mechanics

### Verdict
**APPROVED** with minor suggestions. The core gameplay loop is solid and fun. Recommend adding a brief intro screen explaining controls.
